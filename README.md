# Rule-based-Recommender-system
A pet project for an internet company.

The data has been obscured to protect user privacy. Also, the code has been spinned-up
in the shortest time possible. You are most welcome to fork and improve/build upon it.

The repo contains two recommnder system codes :

1. Genre-based Recommendation.
2. Nearest neighbours based Recommendation.

Give a star if it helped you in anyway :)
